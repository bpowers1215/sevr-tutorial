# 1. Introduction

---

In this tutorial we'll walk through how to setup a simple blog using the
Ichabod CMS Framework. We will begin with installation and end with a fully
functioning blog. The blog will be responsible for managing four sets of data:
users, posts, tags, and media. An authentication strategy will be applied to
a RESTful interface to manage the blog data.

This tutorial is written for an audience with a solid understanding of
JavaScript and some new features found in ES6 will be used. An intimate
knowledge of Node.JS and npm are not necessary.
